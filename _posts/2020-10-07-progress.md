description: The crew progressed well to tackle the diffioculty of the sugar sand layers

The first 5-6 feet we were battling with sugar sand. Our auger bucket was not able to hold the charge, the sugar sand simply flew out while we were trying to lift the bucket out. First we tried to water the hole, but the third auger kit brought help because it's head was styled with a stop feature in mind.
